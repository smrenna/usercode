This directory contains information about how to use
SLHA files to generate LHE files for an mSugra scan.

**NEW** Info on how to make BIASED LHE files
In the directory "code", there are two files:
   pyupev.f
   upveto.f

Put these into Pythia6Interface/src and use "scram".

upveto can be modified to place any veto you would like.
The current implementation only accepts LHE events that
  contain two leptons (e,mu,tau) at the production and
  hard decay level.

Information regarding the cross section and filter acceptance
  are added currently using the shell script local_condor.sh

**END NEW**

The SLHA files were produced in a previous step.
For Summer 11, these were placed in:
UserCode/SusyAnalysis/SLHAFILES/mSugraScan/m0_m12_tanb_A0_signMu.

For example, m0_m12_10_0_1 contains a scan in (m0,m1/2) for
  tanb=10, A0=0, and mu>0  (all dimensionful units in GeV).


For Summer 11, we used Pythia6 to generate the LHE files.
Alternatively, one can imagine using Pythia8 or MadGraph.

Activating the Pythia6 capability to generate an LHE file requires a 
small modification to the Pythia6Interface.   You will need to
check out the interface, replace the code in plugins with the
versions here, and remake with scram.  The steps are something like
this:

cd $CMSSW_BASE/src
addpkg GeneratorInterface/Pythia6Interface
cd GeneratorInterface/Pythia6Interface
cp $(new plugin source)/* plugins/
scramv1 b

Since the generation of the LHE files is fast, the job can be
done using local condor.   (someone else can add instructions on
how to do this with CRAB)

The following setup works as follows:

voms-proxy-init
condor_submit local_condor.submit

In local_condor.submit, you can modify:

SCANDIR == the location of the SLHA files, with a basename
  of (working CMSSW directory)/src/UserCode/SusyAnalysis/SLHAFILES
NOEVENTS == desired number of events per scan point, 10k by default
OFFSET == ability to choose a specific SLHA file for one job

Currently, the SLHA file is fixed by the condor job number.
Thus, if you generate 1 job ("Queue 1" in local_condor.submit),
the SLHA files is the "0" element of a listing of the
SCANDIR directory.    If OFFSET=100, it will select
the "100" element of the same listing.

In local_condor.sh, you can change the location of the SLHA
files (basedir).

Also, in this setup, the condor job number is used along with
bash to select the random number seed for generator part.
I chose this for the sake of reproducibility.

The output of the current run will be a number of LHE files
with the naming convention "msugra_m0_m12_tanb_A0_signMu.lhe",
mimicking the syntax of the SLHA files.

The LHE file is post processed (in the condor run) to add a
comment for each event specifying the model name.  This is
accomplished with the "reformatter.py".

This basic setup can be modified to also generate LHE files
for Simplified Models.

Two other configuration files are included for testing:

  1. testReader_cfg.py tests that the LHE file can be processed into
     an LHEProduce EDM file.

  2. fastsimTest_cfg.py tests the full DataOps processing chain.

  For either case, you will have to modify the names of the input files.

At the end of the condor run, a (large) number of (smallish) LHE files will
have been produced.   Before passing the runs off to DataOps, these files
have to be uploaded into MCDB, a Monte Carlo database.   We have been
doing this in several steps.  One important point to note is that the bluearc
system does not seem to like many, many small files.  Your processing will
run faster if done on a "fixed" disk.

In the first step, we tar the LHE files together, and place them on
a mass storage system (on cmslpc, we use "/pnfs/cms/WAX/resilient/...").
Depending upon the size, you may want to produce several tar files.

In the second step, the tar files are untarred, and the LHE files from
many models are combined.   We aim for a size around 1GB, but that is
variable.  In the process of combining the events, a standard header
is added -- we are told this is necessary to upload several files into
the same MCDB "article".

In the final step, the larger LHE files are uploaded into MCDB.

Some helper scripts to accomplish this are placed in the directory "mcdb".
These have been modified for the SMS uploads, and need to be reformatted
back to work for mSugra.  This is coming.
